# Vendor Guidelines

Vendors can make up an important part of our community, and our Slack Workspace provides a unique method to engage with a user base directly, but vendors should adhere to the following guidelines to help ensure they do not engage in behaviour that violates our Code of Conduct.

## Direct messages

It is not permitted to direct message or use other communications tools to contact a member of our community for the purposes of promoting your product without their clear permission beforehand.

### What is okay

> Vendor: Hey @personX, is it ok if I message you about #productY?

> personX: Sure, that's fine.

### What is not okay

* Sending direct messages or using outside communications tools to contact the user when they have responded in any manner that could be taken as a negative response to a posting in a public channel like the above.

## Promoting your product in public channels

If you wish to promote your product in a public channel, it is important that:

* Your message is relevant to the current discussion topic. For example, if you make a disk partitioning tool, it may be useful to post a link to your own channel if the current discussion is on that topic.
* Your message cannot be considered 'spam' - in addition to being on topic, it shouldn't be posted repeatedly, either in the same channel or in multiple channels.

### What is okay

> personX: I'm looking for a tool that performs X - does anyone have any ideas?

> Vendor: Hey @personX, I work for companyY and we make something that may help. Maybe you would like to come over to #companyY?

### What is not okay

> [Unrelated conversation]

> Vendor: So is it true that :  The new MacOS eliminates IMAGINGâ€¦ Deploy Studio???    [competitor] or OurProduct.com have possible the solutions?

## The `#i-built-a-thing` channel

We have created the `#i-built-a-thing` channel so that vendors, startups, and anyone wishing to promote a new project (free or otherwise) that is relevant to members of the Mac Admins community may post without a requirement to be relevant a current discussion, as is the case in all other public channels. A discussion may be pursued in the thread of the post.

You must still adhere to the remaining guidelines:

* Your message cannot be considered 'spam' -  it shouldn't be posted repeatedly, and should not be reposted in other channels.
* It is advised to create a new channel for your product, service, or tool, and invite people to join that channel if they wish to hear anything more about it.
* Do not add direct links in the `#i-built-a-thing` channel to any competitions, giveaways, surveys, or other means of gathering personal information. Instead, direct people to your own channel or your own website.
